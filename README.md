## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial in preventing severe complications. This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance.
- Prediction on new data inputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
    cd diabetes-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions.
